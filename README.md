Hi All, I'm Luke! I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering Student at Cornell University,
I'm using this Github account mostly as practice for other projects and looking into 
things that I am interested in. I in particular am interested in Data Science, 
Embedded Systems, and will be posting anything else I work on here.
